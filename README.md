# To-Do-frontend
* Run the login.html file initially 

- This program is the front-end of the To-do application
  that is being done for educational purposes.
  It is implemented with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
  It is a simple application that lets users take notes.
  Users are able to add notes, delete notes, and view notes.
  Users are authenticated when accessing the application.
  First, they need to register and their credentials are saved in the database (persistent storage).
  By using these credentials they are able to log in.
  This application gets the information from GUI and
  sends it to the back-end by using RESTAPI to be stored in the database.
  Once the user has an account then they can log in and use the features of the application.
  So using the RESTAPI the backend and frontend communicate with each other.
